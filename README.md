# Creating turnover frequency (TOF) contour plots with MKMCXX

This is a small demo of how you can use the [MKMCXX microkinetics modeling software package](https://mkmcxx.nl/) to generate contour plots of the turnover frequency or degree of rate analysis, such as those found in the [repository](https://github.com/goldsmith-lab/ptru-alloy-no3rr-activity) for our recent [*Journal of Catalysis* article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951720305236).
